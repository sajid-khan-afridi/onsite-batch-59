### API (Application Programming Interface)

An API (Application Programming Interface) serves as a bridge, allowing two or more computers, applications, or programs to communicate with each other. It facilitates data exchange between different systems, such as a database and a user interface, using standard formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

### Key Features:
- **Data Exchange Format**: JSON is widely used to send and receive data in APIs, and it's supported by all major programming languages.
- **API Communication**: The communication between applications through APIs happens via predefined routes or endpoints.

### API Methods:
- **GET**: Used to **read** data from the server.
- **POST**: Used to **create** new data on the server.
- **PATCH**: Used to **update** existing data on the server.
- **DELETE**: Used to **delete** data from the server.

### API Structure:
- **Base URL**: The main URL for the API.
- **Endpoint or Route**: Specific paths or routes for accessing different functionalities. Example: `/status` route for checking API status.

### Example:
- Facebook's API uses authentication to allow users to interact with the platform through different routes.

### Tools:
- **Postman**: A popular tool for testing APIs. It helps developers visualize API requests and responses, making the development and debugging process easier.
